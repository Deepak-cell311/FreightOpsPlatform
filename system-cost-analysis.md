## Market Reality Check

### Competitor Pricing Comparison
```
Your New Pricing vs Market:
- Starter $79 vs TruckingOffice $30-80: Competitive with banking included
- Professional $199 vs Rose Rocket $150-400/user: Still major savings
- Enterprise $399 vs McLeod $300+ per user: Massive value for unlimited users
- Brokers $149-699 vs Legacy $200-500+ per user: Competitive positioning
```

## Recommendation

**Implement the cost-adjusted pricing immediately.** Your original pricing was unsustainable once operational costs are factored in. The new pricing:

1. **Ensures profitability** with realistic customer acquisition goals
2. **Remains competitive** vs market alternatives
3. **Supports quality service** with proper staffing
4. **Enables growth investment** for long-term success

The banking integration still provides significant value that justifies the pricing premium while keeping you competitive in the market.
