## API Endpoints Supporting Dashboards

### Primary Endpoints:
1. **`/api/dashboard/stats`** - Standard dashboard statistics
   - Active loads, revenue, available drivers, total trucks
   - Used by: tenant-dashboard, simple-dashboard, dashboard-simple

2. **`/api/dashboard/recent-activity`** - Activity feed data
   - Recent loads, driver updates, system events
   - Used by: tenant-dashboard, simple-dashboard

3. **`/api/dashboard/metrics`** - Extended metrics set
   - Includes utilization, efficiency, safety scores
   - Used by: dashboard.tsx

4. **`/api/banking/activation-status`** - Banking system status
   - Account activation, banking health
   - Used by: dashboard.tsx, dashboard-simple.tsx

### Supporting Endpoints:
- `/api/dashboard/loads` - Active loads data
- `/api/dashboard/alerts` - System alerts and notifications
- `/api/trial-status` - Account trial status
- `/api/companies` - Company information

---

## Current Routing Configuration

### Active Route (stable-router.tsx):
```typescript
// Line 129: Default fallback for authenticated users
return <TenantDashboard />;
```

### Navigation Structure:
```
/ (root) → TenantDashboard → Dashboard content
/fleet → TenantDashboard → Fleet module
/dispatch → TenantDashboard → Dispatch module
/hr → TenantDashboard → HR module
/accounting → TenantDashboard → Accounting module
/settings → TenantDashboard → Settings module
```

---

## Authentication & Session Management

### Working Authentication Flow:
1. ✅ Login: `POST /api/login` → Session token creation
2. ✅ Token storage: localStorage + session management
3. ✅ API authentication: Bearer token in requests
4. ✅ Logout: `POST /api/logout` → Session cleanup
5. ✅ Route protection: Authentication checks before API calls

### Authentication Issues (Fixed):
- ~~401 errors after logout due to persistent queries~~
- ~~Authentication context provider errors~~
- ~~React Query cache not invalidating on logout~~

---

## Recommendations

### Primary Dashboard: **tenant-dashboard.tsx**
**Why this is the main dashboard:**
1. ✅ **Complete Integration**: Full TenantLayout with navigation
2. ✅ **Multi-Module Support**: Handles all tenant modules in one component
3. ✅ **Production Ready**: Proper error handling and loading states
4. ✅ **Currently Active**: Set as default route for all authenticated users
5. ✅ **Scalable Architecture**: Modular content routing system

### Alternative Dashboards:
- **dashboard.tsx**: Use for advanced analytics features
- **dashboard-simple.tsx**: Use for minimal resource requirements
- **simple-dashboard.tsx**: ❌ Avoid until authentication issues are resolved

### Next Steps:
1. ✅ Continue using tenant-dashboard.tsx as primary
2. 🔄 Monitor authentication stability after recent fixes
3. 📈 Consider dashboard.tsx for advanced metrics when needed
4. 🧹 Clean up or fix simple-dashboard.tsx authentication issues

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure:
```
TenantDashboard (Main Container)
├── TenantLayout (Navigation & Layout)
├── Content Router (Module Switching)
│   ├── Dashboard Content (KPIs + Activity)
│   ├── Fleet Module
│   ├── Dispatch Module
│   ├── HR Module
│   ├── Accounting Module
│   └── Settings Module
└── Error Boundaries & Loading States
```

### Data Flow:
```
Authentication → Route Guard → Dashboard Component → API Calls → UI Updates
```

### State Management:
- **Authentication**: useAuth hook with localStorage persistence
- **API State**: TanStack React Query with tenant-scoped caching
- **UI State**: React hooks for local component state
- **Navigation**: Wouter for client-side routing

---

## Current Status: ✅ STABLE

The dashboard system is currently stable with `tenant-dashboard.tsx` as the primary dashboard. The recent fix to replace the problematic `simple-dashboard.tsx` has resolved the continuous 401 authentication errors. The system now properly handles login/logout flows and maintains consistent authentication state across all dashboard components.
