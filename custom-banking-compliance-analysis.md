## Realistic Financial Comparison (Banking Revenue Only)

### At 100 Customers Scale:
```
FreightOps Subscription Revenue: $119,400/year (100 × $99.50/month average)

Custom Banking (Banking Revenue Only):
- Banking Compliance Costs: -$2,026,000/year
- Banking Revenue: +$500,000/year  
- Banking Net Loss: -$1,526,000/year
- Total Business Profit: $119,400 - $1,526,000 = -$1,406,600

Railsr Partnership (Banking Revenue Only):
- Banking Platform Costs: -$6,000/year
- Banking Revenue Share: +$100,000/year (20% share of banking)
- Banking Net Profit: +$94,000/year
- Total Business Profit: $119,400 + $94,000 = $213,400
```

### At 1,000 Customers Scale:
```
FreightOps Subscription Revenue: $1,194,000/year (1,000 × $99.50/month average)

Custom Banking (Banking Revenue Only):
- Banking Compliance Costs: -$2,026,000/year
- Banking Revenue: +$5,000,000/year
- Banking Net Profit: +$2,974,000/year
- Total Business Profit: $1,194,000 + $2,974,000 = $4,168,000

Railsr Partnership (Banking Revenue Only):

```

## Recommendation Updated

**For FreightOps Pro Launch: Railsr Partnership**

The profit share is significant, but the compliance costs make custom banking impossible until massive scale:

- **Under 500 customers**: Railsr is the only viable option (custom banking loses money)
- **500-2,000 customers**: Railsr still profitable, custom banking breaks even
- **2,000+ customers**: Custom banking becomes more profitable, but requires $2-6M investment

Start with Railsr to validate the market and grow. Once you reach 2,000+ customers and have $5M+ annual revenue, then consider building custom banking infrastructure.

## Recommendation

**For FreightOps Pro: Railsr Partnership is the Clear Winner**

The cost difference is astronomical:
- **Custom**: $2-6 million annually + unlimited risk
- **Railsr**: $1,200-6,000 annually + limited risk

Unless you plan to process $1+ billion annually in transactions, the custom approach makes no financial sense. Railsr allows you to focus on freight innovation while they handle the complex regulatory landscape.

The custom approach would require:
- $500k-2M upfront licensing costs
- 18-month delay to market
- 10,000+ customers just to break even on compliance
- Hiring a team of banking compliance experts

Railsr lets you launch immediately with 1-5 customers to break even, allowing you to validate and grow the freight-specific features that actually differentiate FreightOps Pro.
